      <description>Security of data is tightly coupled to its access policy. However, in practice, a data owner has control of his data&amp;rsquo;s access policies only as far as the boundaries of his own systems. In this paper, we introduce graduated access control, which provides mobile, programmable, and dynamically-resolving policies for access control that extends a data owner&amp;rsquo;s policies across system boundaries. We realize this through a novel data-centric abstraction called trusted capsules and its associated system, the trusted data monitor.</description>
