      <description>&lt;p&gt;Security of data is tightly coupled to its access policy. However, in practice, a data owner has control of his data&amp;rsquo;s access policies only as far as the boundaries of his own systems. In this paper, we introduce graduated access control, which provides mobile, programmable, and dynamically-resolving policies for access control that extends a data owner&amp;rsquo;s policies across system boundaries. We realize this through a novel data-centric abstraction called trusted capsules and its associated system, the trusted data monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trusted capsule couples data and policy into a single mobile unit. A capsule is backwards-compatible and is indistinguishable from a regular file to applications. In coordination with the trusted data monitor a capsule provides data integrity and confidentiality on remote devices, strong authentication to a trusted capsule service, and supports nuanced and dynamic access control decisions on remote systems. We implemented our data monitor using ARM TrustZone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that graduated access control can express novel and useful real world policies, such as revocation, remote monitoring, and risk-adaptable disclosure. We illustrate trusted capsules for different file formats, including JPEG, FODT, and PDF. We also show compatibility with unmodified applications, such as LibreOffice Writer, Evince, and VLC.&lt;/p&gt;
