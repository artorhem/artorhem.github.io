      <description>Revelio is a tool that statically analyses Python code for known vulnerabilities. The tool provides a IDE plugin for Sublime for highlighting vulnerabilities as well as a command-line interfaces that provides the following features:
 Detection of vulnerable functions Detection of dependencies with vulnerabilities Automatic replacement of vulnerable function with safe alternatives Automatically running tests Detecting and updating outdated dependencies Downloading and analyzing of GitHub repositories as well as local files Automatically creating pull-requests to GitHub repositories to fix vulnerable functions  Currently, Revelio is just a prototype which was developed as part of a Software Engineering course.</description>

      <description>Security of data is tightly coupled to its access policy. However, in practice, a data owner has control of his data&amp;rsquo;s access policies only as far as the boundaries of his own systems. In this paper, we introduce graduated access control, which provides mobile, programmable, and dynamically-resolving policies for access control that extends a data owner&amp;rsquo;s policies across system boundaries. We realize this through a novel data-centric abstraction called trusted capsules and its associated system, the trusted data monitor.</description>
