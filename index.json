Understanding the invariants and other behavioral and performance characteristics of a distributed systems is challenging because multiple nodes communicate and coordinate together towards the task of performing a computation.\nVerification methods and tools implicitly assume that the code to be verified is deterministic. That is users of the software will provide relevant inputs, and by verifying program behavior using all possible values of that input, a given verification methodology can draw inferences about a system.\nIn the case of distributed software, the assumption of implicit determinism is void. Network software typically works in collaboration with other compute nodes in order to fulfill the required functionality. For example, in a peer-to-peer system, peers detect node failures using heartbeat messages. Service Oriented Architecture is another example where a number of services communicate using a complex chain of RPC calls. Since the underlying communication takes place in the form of raw packets, often the program behavior can potentially change if the packets are received out of order or packets are lost in the network. Therefore, in this context, both the incoming data and the send/receive order can potentially impact program behavior and consequently increase the complexity of verification methodology.\nAn additional challenge is attributed to concurrency. Most modern systems use multi-threading to achieve better performance. In such a case, the outcome of a program is a function of how individual threads are interleaved together. Reasoning about such interleaved execution paths is hard and adds another layer of complexity to the process of verification.\nGiven the above challenges, we were curious about the usability of existing symbolic execution tools for verification of system software. In particular, we were interested in understanding how easy it is to use symbolic execution to verify systems software that interacts with the networking stack. We, therefore, analyzed Snort using the popular symbolic execution engine named KLEE. We documented the challenges that we encountered along the way. We also looked at recent research papers to understand how they approach the problem of verifying such code.\nPDF\n","date":1545313860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545313860,"objectID":"389b44086699c7c95bfe146825d548da","permalink":"/project/formal_verification/","publishdate":"2018-12-20T13:51:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/formal_verification/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding usability of KLEE by trying to analyse a large Intrusion Detection System","tags":["Formal Verification","systems","software engineering"],"title":"Analysing Snort with KLEE","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Revelio is a tool that statically analyses Python code for known vulnerabilities.

To make the process simple and extensible, we use the tox test framework, that simplifies the execution of the tests. We look at the standard locations to discover tests, and support the standard testing mechanisms. Here are our assumptions:\nThe tests are placed in the ${project}/test[s] directory\nThe requirements necessary are present in a requirements.txt file. Often developers specify multiple versions of this file. We look for all files in the repository that have a name starting with \u0026lsquo;requirements\u0026rsquo; to include for installation in the virtualenv.\nThe supported methods of testing the project are: setup.py with a test recipe, py.tests, nosetests, and plain old unittests.\nKnown issues and fixes When running tox in the macOS terminal the following error might ocurr:\nunknown locale: UTF-8 in Python\n","date":1527301845,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527301845,"objectID":"5baf35d955a49003f5750a7a82f9ee0f","permalink":"/project/revelio/","publishdate":"2018-05-26T02:30:45Z","relpermalink":"/project/revelio/","section":"project","summary":"A tool for doing static analysis of Python code for known vulnerabilities","tags":["Software Engineering"],"title":"Revelio","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Security of data is tightly coupled to its access policy. However, in practice, a data owner has control of his data\u0026rsquo;s access policies only as far as the boundaries of his own systems. In this paper, we introduce graduated access control, which provides mobile, programmable, and dynamically-resolving policies for access control that extends a data owner\u0026rsquo;s policies across system boundaries. We realize this through a novel data-centric abstraction called trusted capsules and its associated system, the trusted data monitor.\nA trusted capsule couples data and policy into a single mobile unit. A capsule is backwards-compatible and is indistinguishable from a regular file to applications. In coordination with the trusted data monitor a capsule provides data integrity and confidentiality on remote devices, strong authentication to a trusted capsule service, and supports nuanced and dynamic access control decisions on remote systems. We implemented our data monitor using ARM TrustZone.\nWe show that graduated access control can express novel and useful real world policies, such as revocation, remote monitoring, and risk-adaptable disclosure. We illustrate trusted capsules for different file formats, including JPEG, FODT, and PDF. We also show compatibility with unmodified applications, such as LibreOffice Writer, Evince, and VLC.\n","date":1527206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527206400,"objectID":"535d24f6b95725ecf701f6f4fc105dd2","permalink":"/project/trusted_capsules/","publishdate":"2018-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trusted_capsules/","section":"project","summary":"ARM TrustZone backed data privacy on remote devices","tags":["Security"],"title":"Trusted Capsules","type":"project"},{"authors":["Puneet Mehrotra","Amanda Carbonari","Peter Chen","Ivan Beschastnikh","Andrew Warfield"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1525996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525996800,"objectID":"3fcbdbb4952f31357efb01a9f9a606c4","permalink":"/talk/tc/","publishdate":"2018-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tc/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Cross-platform Data Integrity and Confidentiality with Graduated Access Control","type":"talk"}]
